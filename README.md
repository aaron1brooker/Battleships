# Battleships

## High-Level Overview

Creating a Battleships game that supports multiple different game modes. 
1) A single-player game where the opposition is a simulated player.
2) A two-player game.
3) One player v computer (salvo - the number of shots per turn is determined by the number of ships the shooter has) game.
4) Two-player game (salvo) game.
5) One player v computer (hidden mines) game.
6) Two player game (hidden mines) game.
7) Computer v computer (hidden mines).
8) Quit.

The code has been written in C++ because I felt that strongly typed language will aid development and reduce bugs as the compiler can catch a vast amount of errors. Also, C++ is a low-latency language however, with the size of this game, this will not result in a significant advantage over other languages. This is also a language I have had great experience with therefore it seemed like the right language for the project.

I have developed in an agile methodology as I anticipated that I would be adding additional features/updates to the game hence why I chose this approach.

Finally, I will be using GitHub as my version control. When I finished developing a story, I ensured that the development was on a different branch to which I could then create a “pull request” (this does not apply when editing the documentation). Usually, another developer would review this code however due to the nature of this being an academic project, I reviewed my own code carefully - to see if I could spot other ways of improving. I also added descriptions on each pull request to allow the examiner to see what the “pull request” was trying to achieve.
